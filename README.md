# VBA_Challenge
 ## Overview
 The purpose of this project is to refactor a script within the worst language known to mankind, Visual Basic, that will output gains or losses in stock values over time at a faster rate than the ~half a second the original code takes to run on my computer.
 If this project weren't short enough to do in a day I would have left it as one of my missing assignments. If I never open the Visual Basic editor again I will consider myself as having lived a happy life.
 I truly loathe this language and I loathe working with it.
